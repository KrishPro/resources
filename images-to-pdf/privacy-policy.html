				<h2>Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
				GDPR applies to European Union member states based users, however if your device is not set up as a European device, or you believe the GDPR should apply to you as well,
				please contact us for further details and help.
				<br/>
				For EU based users, our applications do not collect or store any personal user or device details, nor do they forward any details (personal or not) to any third party 
				(including analytics or crash reporting tools), unless specifically stated in a dialog window with an opt-in action which will never be pre-selected.
				<br/>
				In cases you opt-in to share your details, there will always be an indication of how you can opt-out from the service.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The free versions of the applications display ads, the app will prompt you to choose between personalised and non-personalised ads.
				<br/>
				Google (parent company of Admob, our ads provider) uses location information in their ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see.
				Please note that by choosing non-personalised ads you will still receive ads but they will be less relevant to your interests. 
				<br/>
				Although non-personalized ads do not use mobile ad identifiers for ad targeting, they do still use mobile ad identifiers for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse.
				<br/>
				If you do not wish to see any ads, you should not use the free version of the app, but you can download the paid one if available.
